# Fashion-MNIST-Classification-using-CNN

This project trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset. The goal is to achieve at least 85% validation accuracy while monitoring the model‚Äôs performance over multiple epochs.

Project Overview
Implement a CNN using deep learning frameworks.

Train and evaluate the model on the Fashion MNIST dataset.

Plot cost and accuracy per epoch to analyze training progress.

Achieve the target accuracy and optimize performance using fine-tuning techniques (e.g., dropout, data augmentation).

Key Results
The model effectively reduces cost and improves accuracy over epochs.

Validation accuracy surpasses 85%, meeting the project requirement.

Further optimization can be done to enhance generalization and prevent overfitting.
